## 4. ACCEPT/REJECT LOGIC

### **Decision Criteria** (models/classifier.py, line 121-144)

A resume is **ACCEPTED** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

```python
CONDITION 1: Total Skills ≥ 4
    - If candidate has 4 or more skills detected → ACCEPT

CONDITION 2: Technical Skills ≥ 2 AND Has Experience
    - Technical skills = Programming + AI/ML + Web Development
    - Experience = At least 2 years found in resume → ACCEPT

CONDITION 3: Has Education AND Total Skills ≥ 2
    - Education = Any degree (Bachelor, Master, PhD, Diploma)
    - Total skills ≥ 2 → ACCEPT

CONDITION 4: Total Skills ≥ 3
    - If candidate has 3 skills (even if no experience) → ACCEPT
```

Otherwise → **REJECTED**

### **Why these criteria?**
- **Flexible**: Allows candidates with different strengths to pass
- **Skills-focused**: Values practical skills over just education
- **Experience-aware**: Rewards experienced candidates with technical skills
- **Education-balanced**: Considers formal education + skills combination

### **Examples**

```
Example 1: ACCEPTED
- Skills: Python, Java, SQL, React (4 skills)
- Experience: 0 years
- Education: None
→ ACCEPTED (Condition 1: 4 skills)

Example 2: ACCEPTED
- Skills: Python, Machine Learning (2 tech skills)
- Experience: 2019-2023 (4 years)
- Education: None
→ ACCEPTED (Condition 2: 2 tech skills + experience)

Example 3: REJECTED
- Skills: Excel (1 skill)
- Experience: None
- Education: None
→ REJECTED (No condition met)

Example 4: ACCEPTED
- Skills: Leadership, Communication (2 skills)
- Experience: None
- Education: Bachelor's degree
→ ACCEPTED (Condition 3: education + 2 skills)
```

## 5. FRAUD DETECTION METHODS

### **6 Fraud Detection Checks** (models/classifier.py, line 182-260)

#### **1. AI-Generated Content Detection (25 points)**
**What it checks**: Resume written by AI (ChatGPT, etc.)

**How it works**:
```python
Patterns detected:
- "as an AI" or "language model"
- "I cannot" or "I am unable to"
- "based on my training"
- "I don't have" or "I do not have"
- "as a large language model"
- "I am designed to" or "I am programmed to"

If ANY pattern found → +25 fraud points
```

**Why**: Detects when someone copy-pasted AI-generated content

---

#### **2. Skill Exaggeration (25 points)**
**What it checks**: Unrealistically high number of skills

**How it works**:
```python
Total skills = Count all detected skills

If total_skills > 25:
    → +25 fraud points
    → Warning: "Unusually high number of skills (>25)"
    
If total_skills > 15:
    → +15 fraud points
    → Warning: "High number of skills (>15)"
```

**Why**: Someone with 30+ skills is likely exaggerating or listing irrelevant skills

---

#### **3. Experience-Skills Mismatch (20 points)**
**What it checks**: Junior candidate claiming expert-level skills

**How it works**:
```python
If experience < 2 years AND total_skills > 12:
    → +20 fraud points
    → Warning: "Skills-to-experience ratio suspicious"
```

**Why**: A candidate with <2 years experience is unlikely to master 12+ skills

---

#### **4. Date Inconsistency (30 points)**
**What it checks**: Timeline doesn't make sense

**How it works**:
```python
1. Extract all years (1990-2099) from resume
2. Check if years are in chronological order
3. If NOT in order:
    → +30 fraud points
    → Warning: "Date inconsistencies detected"

Example:
Resume says: "2023-2020 at Company A"
This is backwards! → Fraud detected
```

**Why**: Dates should be chronological (education → work)

---

#### **5. Multiple Education Levels (15 points)**
**What it checks**: Claiming too many degrees

**How it works**:
```python
Detect degrees:
- High School
- Bachelors
- Masters
- PhD

If MORE than 2 degree levels found:
    → +15 fraud points
    → Warning: "Multiple education levels claimed"
```

**Why**: Most people have 1-2 degree levels max

---

#### **6. Missing Contact Information (10 points)**
**What it checks**: No email AND no phone

**How it works**:
```python
If NO email found AND NO phone found:
    → +10 fraud points
    → Warning: "Missing contact information"
```

**Why**: Real resumes always have contact info

---

### **Fraud Score Calculation**

```
Total Fraud Score = Sum of all points (0-100%)

0-29%   = Low Risk ✅ (Green)
30-69%  = Medium Risk ⚠️ (Yellow)
70-100% = High Risk ❌ (Red)
```

---

## 6. DEPARTMENT CLASSIFICATION

### **How Department is Determined**

Uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)**

#### **Training Data** (models/classifier.py, line 35-74)
```
7 Departments with keyword patterns:

IT Department:
- Keywords: python, java, programming, sql, cloud, docker, kubernetes, api

HR Department:
- Keywords: recruitment, hiring, HR management, payroll, benefits, onboarding

Finance Department:
- Keywords: accounting, finance, budgeting, audit, tax, investment, gaap

Marketing Department:
- Keywords: marketing, SEO, social media, content, advertising, branding

Engineering Department:
- Keywords: mechanical, electrical, civil, CAD, manufacturing, construction

Operations Department:
- Keywords: supply chain, logistics, inventory, procurement, operations

Sales Department:
- Keywords: sales, business development, negotiation, client relationship, b2b
```

#### **Classification Process**

```python
1. Combine resume text + extracted skills
2. Convert to TF-IDF feature vector (1000 features)
3. Feed into Random Forest Classifier (100 decision trees)
4. Each tree votes for a department
5. Majority vote wins
6. Output: Department name
```

#### **Fallback Classification**
If ML model fails:
- Tech skills ≥ 2 → IT
- Soft skills ≥ 3 → HR
- Contains "finance/accounting" → Finance
- Contains "marketing/sales" → Marketing
- Otherwise → General

---

## 7. RANKING SYSTEM

### **Overall Ranking Score (0-100)**

**Formula** (models/classifier.py, line 146-180):

```
TOTAL SCORE = Skills + Tech Bonus + Experience + Education

1. Skills Component (40 points max)
   Score = min(total_skills × 4, 40)
   Example: 8 skills → 8 × 4 = 32 points

2. Technical Skills Bonus (20 points max)
   Tech skills = Programming + AI/ML + Web Development
   Score = min(tech_skills × 5, 20)
   Example: 3 tech skills → 3 × 5 = 15 points

3. Experience Component (20 points max)
   Years = max_year - min_year
   Score = min(years × 4, 20)
   Example: 4 years → 4 × 4 = 16 points

4. Education Component (20 points max)
   PhD = 20 points
   Masters = 15 points
   Bachelors = 10 points
   Diploma = 5 points
```

### **Department-Specific Ranking** (models/ranker.py)

Each department has different weight priorities:

```python
IT Department:
- Technical Skills: 40%
- Experience: 30%
- Education: 20%
- Certifications: 10%

HR Department:
- Experience: 40%
- Soft Skills: 30%
- Education: 20%
- Certifications: 10%

Finance Department:
- Experience: 50%
- Education: 30%
- Certifications: 20%

Engineering Department:
- Technical Skills: 50%
- Experience: 30%
- Education: 20%

Sales Department:
- Experience: 40%
- Soft Skills: 40%
- Education: 20%
```
